  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <p>We will show you pairs of triangles. Your task is to rate how similar the two triangles are. You will make your ratings using a slider that ranges from <?php echo $labels[0]; ?> to <?php echo $labels[1]; ?>. You should aim to give each rating in between 5 to 10 seconds. Try to use the full extent of the scale – don’t just concentrate all your ratings in one area of the scale.</p>

  <p>Before you do the main rating task, we will first show you a selection of triangles. Please spend at least 1 minute looking over these to get a feel for the maximum and minimum similarity (i.e. try to figure out which triangles are most similar to each other and which ones are the least similar to each other).</p>

  <p>Click Next when you’re ready to begin.</p>
