    You will shortly see a series of triangles. For each one, type in what you
    think it’s called based on the training you’ve just completed.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may find it very difficult to remember the words for the different triangles.
    Go with your instinct and type in a word that feels right. You will still
    get points for getting a word partially correct.

<?php

// If the participant is in the second condition...
if ($_REQUEST["cond"] == 2) {
    // Add a reminder to say that they can't use the same word more than once
    echo "<p>Remember: if you use a particular word too often, you will see a message asking you to use a different word.</p>";
}
