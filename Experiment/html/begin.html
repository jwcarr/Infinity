    You will see a series of triangles along with the words used to describe them.
    After every third triangle, you will see one of those three triangles again, and you
    must type in the word you just learned for it. You will be told whether or not you got it right.
  </p>

<?php

// If the participant is in the third condition...
if ($_REQUEST["cond"] == 3) {
  echo "
  <p>
    Try to learn the words for the triangles as best as you can, as you will use them to
    communicate with your partner later on.
  </p>
  ";
}

else {
  echo "
  <p>
    Try to learn the words for the triangles as best as you can, as you will be tested on them later.
  </p>";
}
