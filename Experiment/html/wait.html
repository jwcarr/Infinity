  Stage 2: Communication
</div>

<div id='subhead'>
  Stage 2 will begin once both you and your partner are ready.
</div>

<div id='long-instructions'>

  <p>
    You and your partner will take it in turns to communicate about triangles.
  </p>

  <p>
    When it’s your turn to communicate, you’ll be presented with a triangle. You must type
    in the word for this triangle and press Enter to send it to your partner. You must only
    communicate using the Flatlander language that you and your partner just learned.
  </p>

  <p>
    The word you use will show up on your partner’s screen. He or she will see a selection of
    six triangles (including the one that you’re trying to convey). Your partner will have
    to figure out which triangle you’re talking about by clicking on it with the mouse.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may find it very difficult to remember the words for the different triangles.
    Go with your instinct and type in a word that feels right. Your partner may
    still be able to identify it even if it’s only partially correct.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you’re ready to start, click the button below. You may need to
    wait a little while for your partner to be ready too.
