Iterated learning experiment with an infinite meaning space
===========================================================

Written by Jon W. Carr

This is the code used in my final project for the "Evolution of Language and Cognition" master's programme at the University of Edinburgh. It is published here so that others can take what they need, check specifics about my work, or replicate my experiment. Please feel free to fork it.

Includes PHP code for running the experiment, and Python code for analysing the results.

Currently a work in progress. More details will follow here soon.
