<div id='content'>

  <h2><?php echo $error; ?></h2>

  <p>Sorry... there seems to be a problem.</p>

  <p>The most common cause of this error is if you try to refresh the page. To continue from where you left off, <a href="index.php?page=rating&id=<?php echo $rater->id; ?>">click here</a>.</p>

  <p>Please contact the experimenter if you continue to encounter this issue.</p>
